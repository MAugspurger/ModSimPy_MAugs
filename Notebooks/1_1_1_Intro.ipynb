A *system* is something in the real\n","world we are interested in.

We might perform a set of introductory experiments to try to understand how a system behaves.  We might gather already existing data, as we will when we model world population in a couple of weeks. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","But our \"investigation\" might also be more intuitive and speculative in nature.  If we're modeling the impacts of introducing a non-native species to an ecosystem, for instance, we cannot (ethically!) observe that in practice.   In that case, we might consider other earlier introductions of non-native species, and use our knowledge of the ecosystem to speculate about what might happen.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","A QUICK SIDENOTE: when mathematicians and scientists refer to \"intuition\", they don't mean some natural-born insight.  Scientific \"intuition\" is gained through work--the more systems you observe, model, and analyze, the better your sense of how an unfamiliar system will behave.  That \"better sense\" is what we call intuition, and developing that intuition is a key goal of scientific education.  This class, I hope, will be another step on this journey.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Consider an example.  In this chapter, we will model the velocity of a penny as it is dropped from the Empire State Building.  Let's imagine we know nothing about gravity.  Direct investigation in New York City would be difficult and illegal.  But we could do a little experiment with a penny and a ladder to try to get a sense about how the penny would behave.
