    "## The Falling Penny Myth\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have heard that a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building would be going so fast when it hit the pavement that it would be embedded in the concrete; or if it hit a person, it would break their skull.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test this myth by making and analyzing a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model we'll use here is a pretty simply one: in fact, it will look a fair bit like a homework problem from a physics class.  This is an important connection to make, because indeed most of your homework problems in physics (or chemistry, or even biology) are models--that is, they are simplications of a real world situation designed to help us understand the real world situation better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since every model is a simplification, we start with some simplifying assumptions.  To start, we'll assume that the effect of air resistance is small. Because this effect is small, we will ignore it.  Now of course, this means are model will no longer be exactly correct, which might or might not be a problem, depending on how we hope to use the answer.  We can check later to see how \"wrong\" our model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK. Now if air resistance is negligible, the primary force acting on the penny\n",
    "is gravity, which causes the penny to accelerate downward.  We'll set the gravitational acceleration to $g = 9.8 m/s^2$.  Note that even *this* is a simplified model (!): $g$ actually varies with elevation, but again we're going to ignore that variation (this is a pretty good simplification--the error it creates is tiny).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the initial velocity is 0 and the acceleration is $a = g$, the velocity after $t$ seconds is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = g t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the distance the penny has dropped is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = g t^2 / 2$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "These two equations are known as *kinematic equations*, and you'll run into them in your physics classes, if you haven't already.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the time until the penny reaches the sidewalk, we can rearrange the second equation to solve for $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\sqrt{ 2 x / g}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in a value for $g$ and the height of the Empire State Building ($x = 381 m$), we get $t = 8.8$ s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then computing $v = g t$ we get a velocity on impact of $86$ m/s, which is about 190 miles per hour. That sounds like it could hurt."

    "the penny gets to about 29 m/s, the upward force of air resistance\n",
    "equals the downward force of gravity, so the penny stops accelerating.\n",
    "This is the *terminal velocity* of the penny in air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the penny reaches terminal velocity, it doesn't matter how much farther it falls; it hits the sidewalk at about 29 m/s.\n",

    "And, when we got the result `v=86`, we added back the meters per second.  Leaving units of out computation is common practice, but it tends to cause errors, including the very expensive failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999 (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter>).\n",

    "We have three choices.  We could us a units library such as Pint (<https://pint.readthedocs.io/>).\n",
    "This helps to find errors in the code because it recognizes unit mistakes, but I (and most programmers) find it unwieldy: it requires too much attention and mucks up the code.\n",

    "Our second choice is to always use base units.  In the metric system, if I always put my values in $kg$ (kilogram),$m$ (meter), and $s$ (seconds), as well as other more complex base units like Newtons and Watts, I know that my answer will be in base units (presuming I set up my equations correctly).  This often requires using exponents, since a given simulation might include millions of seconds or a small fraction of a kg, but it allows us to generally avoid unit conversions. This is the approach we'll (mostly) use in this textbook.\n",

    "Unfortunately, life does not always provide you with metric base units.  So in some cases, you need to convert data or solutions into more common units (like \"miles per hour\").
