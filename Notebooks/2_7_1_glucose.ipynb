This \"return to normal\" happens in two ways.  First glucose will naturally move out of the blood stream, and second, insulin encourages (or \"catalyzes\") this \"glucose disposal\" process.\n","\n","<br>\n"," \n","* The effect of insulin on glucose disposal, as seen in the data, happens more slowly than we would expect if it depended primarily on the the concentration of insulin in the blood. Bergman's group hypothesized that insulin must move relatively slowly from the blood to a \"remote compartment\"; only when in this \"compartment\" can it affect glucose levels in the body.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Interestingly, at the time, the \"remote compartment\" was a modeling abstraction that might, or might not, represent something physical. Later, this compartment was shown to be interstitial fluid, that is, the fluid\n","that surrounds tissue cells.
