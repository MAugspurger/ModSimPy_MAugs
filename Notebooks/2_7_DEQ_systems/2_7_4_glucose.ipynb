Now we'll implement the other half of the Minimal Model.  In the glucose minimal model, we created a function $I(t)$ from data, and used that as input as we attempted to model glucose levels $G$ and tissue insulin $X$.

Because we are assuming a level of $G$ defined by experimental data $G(t)$, we don't need to worry about how much the insulin is reducing glucose (and thus how much is in the blood vs.  the tissue fluid).  Here we are only interested in how glucose in the blood stream prods the body to change insulin production.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The code hidden in the next cell imports the glucose and insulin data as the DataFrame `data` with columns called `glucose` and `insulin`."],"metadata":{"id":"jzTzeHRHRV1Q"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"_k76xAkRQUAi"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title\n","# Import necessary libraries\n","from os.path import basename, exists\n","from os import mkdir\n","\n","def download(url,folder):\n","    filename = folder + basename(url)\n","    if not exists(folder):\n","        mkdir(folder)\n","    # fetches the file at the given url if it is not already present\n","    if not exists(filename):\n","        from urllib.request import urlretrieve\n","        local, _ = urlretrieve(url, filename)\n","        print('Downloaded ' + local)\n","\n","download('https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Notebooks/'\n","        + 'ModSimPy_Functions/modsim.py', 'ModSimPy_Functions/')\n","download('https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Notebooks/'\n","        + 'ModSimPy_Functions/chap06.py', 'ModSimPy_Functions/')\n","\n","from ModSimPy_Functions.modsim import *\n","from ModSimPy_Functions.chap06 import *\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","filename = 'https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Data/glucose_insulin.csv'\n","# If you are using this notebook offline, you will need to upload this data\n","# from the Images_and_Data folder.
