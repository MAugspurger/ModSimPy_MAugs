Simulation often comes in the form of a computer program. Analysis often comes in the form of algebra and calculus; that is, symbolic manipulation using mathematical notation.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Analysis and simulation have different capabilities and limitations.\n","Simulation is generally more versatile; it is easy to add and remove parts of a program and test many versions of a model, as we have done in the previous examples.  Simulation can also more effectively address complex physical situations.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","But there are several things we can do with analysis that are harder or impossible with simulations:\n","\n","*   With analysis we can sometimes compute, exactly and efficiently, a value that we could only approximate, less efficiently, with\n","    simulation. For example, in the quadratic model we plotted net growth versus population and saw it crosses through zero when the population is\n","    near 14 billion.  We could estimate the crossing point using a\n","    numerical search algorithm (more about that later). But with a bit of algebra, we derived the general result that $K=-\\alpha/\\beta$.\n","    \n","\n","*   Analysis sometimes provides \"computational shortcuts\", that is, the\n","    ability to jump forward in time to compute the state of a system\n","    many time steps in the future without computing the intervening\n","    states.\n","    \n","\n","*  We can use analysis to state and prove generalizations about models;\n","    for example, we might prove that certain results will always or\n","    never occur. With simulations, we can show examples and sometimes\n","    find counterexamples, but it is hard to write proofs.\n","\n","\n","*  Analysis can provide insight into models and the systems they\n","    describe; for example, sometimes we can identify regimes of\n","    qualitatively different behavior and key parameters that control\n","    those behaviors."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"graduate-conducting","metadata":{"id":"graduate-conducting"},"source":["### Analysis with WolframAlpha\n","\n","Until recently, most analysis was done, as they say, by rubbing graphite on wood\n","pulp, a process that is laborious and error-prone.
