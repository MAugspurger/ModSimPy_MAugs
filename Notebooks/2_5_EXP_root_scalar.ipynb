To understand what that means, suppose we're trying to find a root of a function of one variable, $f(x)$, and assume we have evaluated the function at two places, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and found that the results have opposite signs. Specifically, assume $f(x_1) > 0$ and $f(x_2) < 0$, as shown in the following diagram:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/secant.PNG width = 300>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"divided-sailing","metadata":{"id":"divided-sailing"},"source":["If $f$ is a continuous function, there must be at least one root in this\n","interval.
