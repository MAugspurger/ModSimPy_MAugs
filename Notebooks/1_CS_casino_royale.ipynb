The type of modeling we've been doing is called *stochastic* modeling, which means that there is an element of chance in our models: each time we run the model, we get different answers, just as in some real circumstances we can expect a range of results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ab2dfec7","metadata":{"id":"ab2dfec7"},"source":["So gambling represents a classic example of a stochastic situation.  In this exercise, you will test out two different strategies for playing the game of roulette, to test whether betting strategy makes a difference in a game of pure chance.\n","\n","But it also gives you a chance to create your own simulation, which can be very satisfying (as well as teeny-tiny bit frustrating : ).  The next box explains your task."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3dca1a0f","metadata":{"id":"3dca1a0f"},"source":["### The Task\n","\n","Your boss at Questionable Enterprises, Inc. has asked you to investigate roulette (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette).  He's convinced that if you just keep betting half of your money at roulette that you are sure to make money: after all, you can never run out of money, but have the opportunity to win a big pot.  \n","\n","So he wants you to compare two scenarios.  In the first one, the gambler will bet 2 dollars every bet.  In the second one, the gambler will bet half the remaining money, no matter how much money is remaining (so the gambler's first bet will be 50 dollars; if that bet loses, the next bet would be 25 dollars, etc...)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"228bda5d","metadata":{"id":"228bda5d"},"source":["### The details\n","\n","Here are the details.  In both cases:\n","\n","- The gambler starts with \\$100\n","- The gambler always bets according to the rule for that simulation (\\$2 or half the remaining money)\n","- The gambler always bets on a single number\n","- The gambler bets 100 times and then stops, no matter what the results are\n","- In both cases, you will run 100 simulations of the situation\n","- In roulette, you have a 1/38 chance of winning (36 numbers, 0, and 00).   The payout for a win is 36 times the bet (as well as the return of the bet).  The difference between 38 and 36 is called the *vig*, which is what keeps the casino in business and what makes gambling a Questionable Enterprise (TM).  So to be clear: if the gambler bets 2 dollars on the first bet, and wins, the remaining money would be $ \\$ 100 + (36*\\$ 2) = \\$ 172$.\n","\n","Which of these details are part of the system parameters?  Which should define the state of the system?  Make some notes to yourself about these values."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"574300b8","metadata":{"id":"574300b8"},"source":["### The Simulation\n","\n","This will be your own simulation, but that doesn't mean you need to start from scratch.  Copy-and-paste is still your friend!  What similarities do you see with the Bikeshare simulation?\n","\n","Here is what you'll need to do to finish the simulations.  You might think of doing each one of these in a single Jupyter cell.  And don't forget to make notes in the code to help you remember what you are doing.\n","\n","- Define a state Series\n","- Define your system parameters (using a `dictionary` if you'd like)\n","- Define a change_function for each time step.  \n","- Define a run_simulation function.  \n","- Decide on a metric, or multiple metrics to compare the simulations.  Mean remaining money?  Median? Percentage of cases where the gambler came out ahead?  You decide which of these (or another) makes the most sense.\n","- Define a run_multiple_simulations function that returns your metric(s)\n","- Write an explanation of your results in a final Markdown cell.  What did you find?  Write as if you are reporting back to your boss--you want to make your findings clear (and he has no interest in looking at code output!  That's for tech people, and he's a big picture thinker!).  What did you learn that he should know?\n","\n","Don't do all of this twice!  You may need 2 change_functions, but all of your other functions should work identically for the two cases.\n","\n","You can work on this project alone, or you can work in pairs: but if you work in pairs, you *must* work together physically in the same place, and you *must* switch often between the \"driver\" and the \"navigator\" roles."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6fea33eb","metadata":{"id":"6fea33eb"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.8"},"colab":{"name":"1_7_casino_royale.ipynb","provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
