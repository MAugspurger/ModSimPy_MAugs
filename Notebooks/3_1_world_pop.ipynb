    "In this chapter we wrote the growth models from the previous chapters in terms of difference and differential equations. We solved some of these equations by hand; for others, we used WolframAlpha and SymPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I called the \"constant growth\" model is more commonly called *linear growth* because the solution is a line.  If we model time as continuous, the solution is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = p_0 + c t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ is net annual growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the proportional growth model is usually called *exponential growth* because the solution is an exponential function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = p_0 \\exp{\\alpha t}$$"

    "Finally, the quadratic growth model is called *logistic growth* because the solution is a logistic function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + A \\exp(-rt)}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $A = (K - p_0) / p_0$.\n",

    "I avoided these terms until now because they are based on results we had not derived yet.\n",

    "With that, we are done modeling world population growth.\n",
