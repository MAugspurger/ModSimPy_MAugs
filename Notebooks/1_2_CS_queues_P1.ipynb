Who knew that was a thing, eh?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Suppose you are designing the checkout area for a new store.  There is room for two checkout counters and a waiting area for customers.  You can make two lines, one for each counter, or one line that serves both counters. In theory, you might expect a single line to be better, but it has some practical drawbacks: in order to maintain a single line, you would have to install rope barriers, it might take up more space, and customers might be put off by what seems to be a longer line, even if it moves faster.  This figure shows the two scenarios we'll consider:\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/queues2.PNG width = 600>\n","\n","So let's build a model and simulation that tests whether the single line is really better and by how much. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nf5uqA4WUvbu"},"source":["### Part 1: Investigation\n","\n","✅  What determines how long a line gets at a store?

Obviously if more customers arrive than leave, there will be a line.  Let's denote the possibility of a customer arriving by using the Greek letter lambda, $\\lambda$, or the variable name `lam`.  The value of $\\lambda$ probably varies during the day, but let's assume it is constant.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Let's say that based on data from other stores, we know that it takes 5 minutes for a customer to check out, on average.  But checkout times are highly variable: most customers take less than 5 minutes, but some take substantially more.  So instead of just saying \"each customer leaves 5 minutes after he gets to the head of the line,\" we can incorporate this variability by assuming that when a customer is checking out, they have the same probability of finishing up during each minute.  I'll denote this probability using the Greek letter mu, $\\mu$, or the variable name `mu`.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","If we choose $\\mu=1/5$, the average number of time steps for each checkout will be 5 minutes, which is consistent with the data.  Most people take less than 5 minutes, but a few take substantially longer, which is probably not a bad model of the distribution in real stores.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","To ease our implementation, we'll also start by assuming there is a single checker and a single line."],"metadata":{"id":"Mm6_OXz8pq8-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a_wY7GEyUvb2"},"source":["### Part 3: Implementation: State and Change\n","\n","Like Bikeshare, this is an initial value problem: we need a `state object` to store the state of the system, and a change function.
