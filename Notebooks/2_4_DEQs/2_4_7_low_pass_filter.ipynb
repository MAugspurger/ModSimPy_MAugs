By simulating the differential equation, we can predict the effect of this circuit on any input signal.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The change in the $V_{out}$ (i.e. the output signal) can be represented by this differential equation:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$$ \\frac{d  V_{out}}{dt} = \\frac{I}{C}$$\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","where $C$ is capacitance, or size, of the capacitor.  What does this mean?  The change in $V_{out}$ depends on how many electrons are moving through the resistor onto the capacitor, divided by how many electrons can actually fit onto the capacitor.  If electrons are flooding through the resistor because the current is high, the voltage will change a lot: this makes sense!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","If we sub Ohm's law ($I=\\Delta V/R$) into the right hand side and rearrange, we get a different form of the differential equation:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$$ \\frac{d V_{out} }{dt} = \\frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{R C} $$\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","This makes physical sense, too.  $V_{in}-V_{out}$ is large, there is a large force pushing electrons through the resistor.  If the resistor is large, fewer electrons will flow.  And if the capacitor is large, it will take more electrons to change the voltage at $V_{out}$.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","If we rearrange the above equation, we can see that it looks a lot like Newton's Law of Cooling:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$$ \\frac{d V_{out} }{dt} = -\\frac{1}{R C}(V_{out} - V_{in})$$\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$RC$ is called the *time constant* of the circuit, because it indicates in a general way how quickly the circuit responds to changes in the input signal: like the coefficient $r$ in the Law of Cooling, it determines the rate of change.  If the time constant $RC$ is large, $\\frac{d }{dt} V_{out}$ will generally be small--that is, $V_{out}$ will not be able to keep up with high frequency input signals, and so those signals will be filtered out.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","In class, we'll use this equation to simulate the behavior of a low pass filter.   The added challenge will be that while in Newton's Law of Cooling $T_{env}$ is usually constant, in this equation $V_{in}$ is generally not constant.  But we'll be up to the challenge!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8q6aKK7igKrw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---"],"metadata":{"id":"P4Pjp2eNw8vU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@markdown ##### <br> *Matching Question* <br><br>Enter the correct 'definition' letters, with a space in between each, in the order of the 'Terms'.
