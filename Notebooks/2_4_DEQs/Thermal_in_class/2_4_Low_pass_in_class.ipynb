These signals are often *complex*: they contain multiple dynamic signals all added together to create a complicated data set.   One way of simplifying such a data set is to *filter* the signal: if we know that the high frequency component of an input signal is some kind of unwanted \"noise\", we can take those high frequency components out using a *low pass filter*.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","In this notebook, we will simulate the low-pass filter for input signals to determine how well they remove unwanted noise.
