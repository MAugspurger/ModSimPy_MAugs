From the Insert menu select \"Text cell\" to add a cell below this one (Text cells are sometimes referred to as \"Markdown cells\" in Jupyter instructions).  You can also use the `+ Text` in the tool bar to add a text cell.\n","\n","2.   In the new cell, add the print statement `print('Hello')`.  You should see a preview of the text cell either to the right or below your new cell. To 'run' the text cell, either press `Shift-Enter` or click in an adjacent text cell.\n","\n","3.  Now create a new \"Code\" cell.  In the new cell, type `print('Hello')` again, and then run it using `Shift-Enter`.  This is your first use of Python!\n","\n","4. Highlight a text cell by clicking on it once. Notice the arrow buttons in the toolbar at the upper right of the cell.  Use the arrows to move the cell up and down. Hover over the other icons in the toolbar to see what they do.  Open the \"editor settings\" if you want to change the appearance (try the \"Corgi Mode\" under miscellaneous).\n","\n","5. Keyboard shortcuts are quite useful.  Click `Tools >> Command Palette` in the main toolbar or type `ctrl-shift-P`, and browse the various tools and short cuts.  In Colab, some of the common keyboard short cuts (`ctrl-z`for 'undo', for instance) are slightly different: you need to hold down 'M' as well (`ctrl-m-z`), if you want to undo a change to at the cell level (the usual `ctrl-z` works fine when changing text within a cell).\n","\n","6.  Now delete one of the cells that you created.  Open the Command Palette with `ctrl-shift-p` and find the keyboard short cut for delete.  Click on the cell you want to delete, and use the `delete` keyboard shortcut.\n","\n","7. As you make changes, Jupyter saves your notebook automatically, but if you want to make sure, you can go to `File >> Save` or click `ctrl-s`.\n","\n","That should be enough basics for now.  But take a couple minutes to explore the tools in Colab/ Jupyter, and don't be afraid to test something out: you can always open a clean version of the notebook.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","---\n","\n","<br>"],"id":"environmental-wallet"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"hourly-financing","metadata":{"id":"hourly-financing"},"source":["## The Modeling Framework\n","\n","This book is about modeling and simulating physical systems.
