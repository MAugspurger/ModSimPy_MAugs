Imagine if a map were the same size as the landscape depicted in the map: this wouldn't be a very useful model! \n","\n","So to model the system, we have to decide which elements of the real world to include and which we can leave out.  This process is called *abstraction*.\n","\n","The abstracted (i.e. simplified) model is a description of the system that includes only the features we think are essential.

In creating a model that duplicates the system behavior, we can observe the \"rules\" that control the system.  Weather, for instance, is extremely complicated: but if we can build a model that behaves (roughly) like the real system, we will have a better understanding of what factors determine that complex behavior.  \"How does the humidity of the air factor into the production of rain clouds?\"\n","\n","*   *Predict* what will happen to a system.  Once we have a model that imitates past behavior, we can begin to estimate future behavior.  \"Is it going to rain tomorrow?\"\n","\n","*   *Optimize* a design in order to achieve a purpose.  If our model accurately predicts system behavior, we can change one factor in the model to improve a design.  \"If we increase the angle of this windmill blade by a degree, will that increase our power output?\"\n","\n","You can see that all three of these aims depend on the accuracy of our model: a faulty model harms more than it helps.  Making sure a model is accurate is called *validation*: we *validate* our models by taking\n","*measurements* from the real world and comparing the data we get\n","with the results from our model."],"metadata":{"id":"3pnSkuojUirg"},"id":"3pnSkuojUirg"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"center-accommodation","metadata":{"id":"center-accommodation"},"source":["### Choosing and iterating a model\n","\n","For any physical system, there are many possible models, each one\n","including and excluding different features, or including different\n","levels of detail. The goal of the modeling process is to find the model\n","best suited to its particular purpose (explanation, prediction, or optimization).\n","\n","Sometimes the best model is the most detailed. If we include more\n","features, the model is more realistic, and we expect its predictions to\n","be more accurate.\n","\n","But often a simpler model is better. If we include only the essential\n","features and leave out the rest, we get models that are easier to work\n","with, and the explanations they provide can be clearer and more\n","compelling.\n","\n","As an example, suppose someone asks you why the orbit of the Earth is\n","elliptical. If you model the Earth and Sun as point masses (ignoring\n","their actual size), compute the gravitational force between them using\n","Newton's law of universal gravitation, and compute the resulting orbit\n","using Newton's laws of motion, you can show that the result is an\n","ellipse.\n","\n","Of course, the actual orbit of Earth is not a perfect ellipse, because\n","of the gravitational forces of the Moon, Jupiter, and other objects in\n","the solar system, and because Newton's laws of motion are only\n","approximately true (they don't take into account relativistic effects).\n","But adding these features to the model would not improve the\n","explanation; more detail would only be a distraction from the\n","fundamental cause. However, if the goal is to predict the position of\n","the Earth with great precision, including more details might be\n","necessary.\n","\n","Choosing the best model depends on what the model is for. It is usually\n","a good idea to start with a simple model, even if it is likely to be too\n","simple, and test whether it is good enough for its purpose. Then you can\n","add features gradually, starting with the ones you expect to be most\n","essential.

Keyboard shortcuts are quite useful.  Click `Tools >> Command Palette` in the main toolbar or type `ctrl-shift-P`, and browse the various tools and short cuts.  In Colab, some of the common keyboard short cuts (`ctrl-z`for 'undo', for instance) are slightly different: you need to hold down 'M' as well (`ctrl-m-z`), if you want to undo a change to at the cell level (the usual `ctrl-z` works fine when changing text within a cell).\n","\n","6.

As you make changes, Jupyter saves your notebook automatically, but if you want to make sure, you can go to `File >> Save` or click `ctrl-s`.\n","\n","That should be enough basics for now.
