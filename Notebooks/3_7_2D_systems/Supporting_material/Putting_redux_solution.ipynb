You want to have the ball stop as close to the hole as possible.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","First, experiment a little to figure out approximately how hard you need to hit it to get it to stop there.  You'll want to adjust your initial state values for velocity, too, to get a sense of which direction you need to hit the ball.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Once you've decided on a pretty good velocity, find the best angle (measured from the positive x-axis) to hit the ball at that velocity.  You can either use a loop to search through possible angles (like we did with the shift-constant problem earlier in the term) or use `minimize_scalar` (like we did in Notebook 3.7.2)."],"metadata":{"id":"hWwSHh9U0TPs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["I've also include a fancier `plot_trajectory` that overlays the path of the ball onto the contour map: to use this function, you will need to call the coordinates of your hole location 'xh' and 'yh' (or you can change this function to match your variable names)."],"metadata":{"id":"6KmqtXYVhyaT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Make a state object and assign initial values\n","x_init = 2.0\n","y_init = 2.0\n","vx_init = 2.0\n","vy_init = 8.0\n","state = pd.Series(dict(x=x_init, y=y_init, vx =vx_init, vy=vy_init), dtype=float)\n","\n","# Parameters\n","mu = 0.15\n","m = 0.046\n","C_d = 0.7\n","r = 0.0216\n","rho = 1.2\n","t_end = 10\n","dt = 0.1\n","g = 9.8\n","xh = 8.0; yh = 18.0\n","speed = np.sqrt(vx_init**2 + vy_init**2)\n","\n","# Make a system object\n","system = dict(mu=mu,m=m,C_d=C_d,r=r,rho=rho,t_end=t_end,dt=dt,\n","              points=points,grad=grad, g=g, xh=xh, yh=yh,\n","              x_init=x_init, y_init=y_init, speed=speed)"],"metadata":{"id":"CIjhY2TGA-l4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["results = run_simulation(system,state,change_func_drag)\n","plot_trajectory_contour(results,system)"],"metadata":{"id":"k_nMnWhBBgDG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def angle_to_x(mag,angle):\n","    theta = np.deg2rad(angle)\n","    x = mag * np.cos(theta)\n","    return x\n","\n","def angle_to_y(mag,angle):\n","    theta = np.deg2rad(angle)\n","    y = mag * np.sin(theta)\n","    return y\n","\n","def range_func(angle, system):\n","    # Unpack the necessary variables\n","    x_init, y_init = system['x_init'], system['y_init']\n","    speed = system['speed']\n","    xh,yh = system['xh'], system['yh']\n","\n","    # Create a new initial state with 'angle' from the argument\n","    state = pd.Series(dict(x=x_init, y=y_init,\n","                       vx=angle_to_x(speed, angle),\n","                       vy=angle_to_y(speed, angle)))\n","    results = run_simulation(system, state, change_func_drag)\n","\n","    # Find the minimum distance from hole\n","    dist = np.sqrt((results.x.iloc[-1] - xh)**2 + (results.y.iloc[-1] - yh)**2)\n","    return dist"],"metadata":{"id":"BMV2yfpcCHGe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["range_func(75, system)"],"metadata":{"id":"bd41qDY8DhZ0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define the angles we will test\n","angles = np.linspace(65, 85, 41)\n","\n","# Create a Series to hold our results\n","sweep = pd.Series([],dtype=np.float64)\n","\n","# Run a simulation at all the test angles and save the results\n","for angle in angles:\n","    dist = range_func(angle, system)\n","    sweep[angle] = dist\n","sweep.plot(xlabel='Launch angle (degree)',\n","         ylabel='Range (meter)',marker='.', figsize = [6,4]);"],"metadata":{"id":"OoL-uX_DErWu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def plot_trajectory_contour(results,system):\n","    x = results.x.values\n","    y = results.y.values\n","    x_vs_y = pd.Series(data=y,index=x)\n","    y_arr = ([system['yh']])\n","    x_arr = ([system['xh']])\n","    hole_loc = pd.Series(data=y_arr,index=x_arr)\n","\n","    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,10))\n","    cs = ax.contour(np.array(data.columns), np.array(data.index), green, levels=15)\n","    ax.clabel(cs,colors='black', fmt = '%1.3f');\n","    ax.set(title='Optimized Lag Putt', xlabel='X-coordinate', ylabel='Y-coordinate');\n","\n","    x_vs_y.plot(xlabel='x position (m)',\n","             ylabel='y position (m)',figsize=[6,9], xlim=[0,12.2],ylim=[0,21.3])\n","    hole_loc.plot(style = 'o')"],"metadata":{"id":"6mhgv6To-bBH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
