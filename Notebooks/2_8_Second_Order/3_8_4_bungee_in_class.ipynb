Now we'll include that factor, using the paper by [Heck, Uylings, and Kędzierska](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/45/1/007).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Just a word about the counter-intuitive nature of this process.

If you have taken calculus, you might recognize the use of the product rule here (if you haven't, no big deal!).  But what does this mean?

There is no outside force being applied to the system, so it is not accelerating, but it is moving at a quick constant velocity.  It is dropping a space mine off every couple of seconds, but it doesn't want the mine to move after its been dropped off.  In essence, the ship has to *push* the mine backwards to reduce the mine's velocity to zero, and in doing so the mine pushes the spaceship forward (this is a Third Law, equal/opposite reaction).  So by jettisoning mass and slowing that mass down, the ship is sped up.  The larger the mine, and the faster the ship, the larger the effect! This is like the falling bungee jumper leaving sections of rope behind: the momentum that the rope loses as it stops is passed onto the remaining rope and the object.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","That's some crazy physics for you, right there.
