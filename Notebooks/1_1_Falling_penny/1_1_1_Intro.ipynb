The first, which we might call “thinking like a human”, involves trying to observe a complex system and simplify it in ways that allow us to understand it, to “get our heads around it.”   This is *modeling*: using physical understanding, math, and computers to simplify the world enough that we can react intelligently to that world.   \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","“Thinking like a computer”, on the other hand, requires us to build structures of thought (arguments, instructions, explanations) using strict logic.  Terms must be literally defined; steps in the argument or explanation must build clearly on earlier steps; and conclusions must be supported and restrained by data.   To build and understand any simulation, we need to be able to understand how the strict, almost inhuman, logic of a computer works.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","These two ways of thinking are crucial in modeling and simulation.  But that's not all.  They are at the heart of science and engineering.   Thinking like human is central to what we sometimes call “physical intuition”: the ability to understand a physical situation “at a glance”.  Not “intuition” at all, physical intuition is built through experience and study, and really is just another way of saying that we have a set of models in our heads that explain the physical world.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","For example, we might learn from a textbook  that an object in freefall accelerates according to this equation:\n","\n"," <br> $$v = gt$$ <br>\n","\n","If we just use that to calculate a value for velocity by plugging in values for $g$ (gravitational constant),  and $t$ (time), we aren't really developing our physical intuition.  We are just finding a number.  But if we use that equation to understand that an object in a vacuum, no matter its mass, will go faster and faster with time, then we are developing our physical intuition.  We're modeling in our heads, thinking like a human.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/1_1/Like_a_human.PNG width = 400>\n","\n"," <br>\n","\n","Thinking like a computer, on the other hand, is not just about learning to code.  The careful logic of coding should be a model for much of our scientific thinking and communication.   The step-by-step structure of coding and its dependence on data is a useful model for scientific writing, which also should be structured in clear way and depend on data.  We should be able to organize our thoughts in this structured way, whether we are coding, writing, or just thinking through a problem.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/1_1/Like_a_computer.PNG width = 400>\n","\n"," <br>\n","\n","This explains in large part why PHYS 200 is an intro level course: the types of thinking that are the deliberate focus of this course are the foundations of engineering and scientific work.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cwefflvctrJw"},"id":"cwefflvctrJw"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"confirmed-budapest","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"confirmed-budapest"},"source":["## Jupyter Cells (Two Types)\n","\n","\n","Now let's play around a little bit with our environment!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/1_1/Coding_is_fun.PNG width = 400>\n","\n"," <br>\n","\n","This is a Jupyter notebook in Colaboratory, which is an online *integrated development environment* (IDE): all this means is that it provides a convenient and useful environment in which you can write and run Python code.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Each notebook is divided into cells.  Each cell contains either text (like this cell) or Python code.  In Colab, the cells are recognizable from the \"shadow\" that shows up when you click on the cell: single click on this cell and notice the cell box.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"environmental-wallet"},"source":["Now let's learn to manipulate the two types of cells.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","Try the following exercises:\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","1. From the Insert menu select \"Text cell\" to add a cell below this one (Text cells are sometimes referred to as \"Markdown cells\" in Jupyter instructions).  Or even better, hover over the bottom line of this cell, and look for the `+ Text` box to appear, and click that.\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","2.   In the new cell, add the print statement `print('Hello World')`.  You should see a preview of the text cell either to the right or below your new cell. To 'run' the text cell, either press `Shift-Enter` or click in an adjacent text cell.\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","3.  Now create a new \"Code\" cell.  In the new cell, type `print('Hello World')` again, and then run it using `Shift-Enter`.  This is your first use of Python!\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","4. Highlight a text cell by clicking on it once. Notice the arrow buttons in the toolbar at the upper right of the cell.  Use the arrows to move the cell up and down. Hover over the other icons in the toolbar to see what they do.  Open the \"editor settings\" if you want to change the appearance (try the \"Corgi Mode\" under miscellaneous).  Don't worry that you are changing the notebook: you can always reopen a clean copy from Moodle if you need to!\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","5. Keyboard shortcuts are quite useful.  Click `Tools >> Command Palette` in the main toolbar or type `ctrl-shift-P`, and browse the various tools and short cuts.  In Colab, some of the common keyboard short cuts (`ctrl-z`for 'undo', for instance) are slightly different: you need to hold down 'M' as well (`ctrl-m-z`), if you want to undo a change to at the cell level (the usual `ctrl-z` works fine when changing text within a cell).\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","6.  Now delete one of the cells that you created.  Open the Command Palette with `ctrl-shift-p` and find the keyboard short cut for delete.  Click on the cell you want to delete, and use the `delete` keyboard shortcut.\n","<br>\n","\n","7. Now delete another cell by using the trash can in the upper right toolbar for that cell (next to the up and down arrows).\n","\n","8. Find the Table of Contents: click on the three horizontal lines in the upper left of the screen.  Notice that there is also a Search tool here: useful for finding bits of code in a notebook!  Search for the word \"intuition.\"\n","\n","\n","8. As you make changes, Jupyter saves your notebook automatically, but if you want to make sure, you can go to `File >> Save` or click `ctrl-s`.  Notice that it will prompt you to \"Save a Copy\" of the file in a directory called \"Colab Notebooks\" in your Google Drive.  You can move the file to a new location after saving it.\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","That should be enough basics for now.
