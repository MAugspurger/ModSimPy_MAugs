The first, which we might call “thinking like a human”, involves trying to observe a complex system and simplify it in ways that allow us to understand it, to “get our heads around it.”   This is *modeling*: using physical understanding, math, and computers to simplify the world enough that we can react intelligently to that world.   \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","“Thinking like a computer”, on the other hand, requires us to build structures of thought (arguments, instructions, explanations) using strict logic.  Terms must be literally defined; steps in the argument or explanation must build clearly on earlier steps; and conclusions must be supported and restrained by data.   To build and understand any simulation, we need to be able to understand how the strict, almost inhuman, logic of a computer works.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","These two ways of thinking are crucial in modeling and simulation.  But that's not all.  They are at the heart of science and engineering.   Thinking like human is central to what we sometimes call “physical intuition”: the ability to understand a physical situation “at a glance”.  Not “intuition” at all, physical intuition is built through experience and study, and really is just another way of saying that we have a set of models in our heads that explain the physical world.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","For example, we might learn from a textbook  that an object in freefall accelerates according to this equation:\n","\n"," <br> $$v = gt$$ <br>\n","\n","If we just use that to calculate a value for velocity by plugging in values for $g$ (gravitational constant),  and $t$ (time), we aren't really developing our physical intuition.  We are just finding a number.  But if we use that equation to understand that an object in a vacuum, no matter its mass, will go faster and faster with time, then we are developing our physical intuition.  We're modeling in our heads, thinking like a human.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/1_1/Like_a_human.PNG width = 400>\n","\n"," <br>\n","\n","Thinking like a computer, on the other hand, is not just about learning to code.  The careful logic of coding should be a model for much of our scientific thinking and communication.   The step-by-step structure of coding and its dependence on data is a useful model for scientific writing, which also should be structured in clear way and depend on data.  We should be able to organize our thoughts in this structured way, whether we are coding, writing, or just thinking through a problem.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/1_1/Like_a_computer.PNG width = 400>\n","\n"," <br>\n","\n","This explains in large part why PHYS 200 is an intro level course: the types of thinking that are the deliberate focus of this course are the foundations of engineering and scientific work.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cwefflvctrJw"},"id":"cwefflvctrJw"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"confirmed-budapest","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"confirmed-budapest"},"source":["## Jupyter Cells (Two Types)\n","\n","\n","\n","This is a Jupyter notebook in Colaboratory, which is an online *integrated development environment* (IDE): all this means is that it provides a convenient and useful environment in which you can write and run Python code.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Each notebook is divided into cells.

You can also use the `+ Text` in the tool bar to add a text cell.\n","\n","2.   In the new cell, add the print statement `print('Hello')`.

Keyboard shortcuts are quite useful.  Click `Tools >> Command Palette` in the main toolbar or type `ctrl-shift-P`, and browse the various tools and short cuts.  In Colab, some of the common keyboard short cuts (`ctrl-z`for 'undo', for instance) are slightly different: you need to hold down 'M' as well (`ctrl-m-z`), if you want to undo a change to at the cell level (the usual `ctrl-z` works fine when changing text within a cell).\n","\n","6.  Now delete one of the cells that you created.  Open the Command Palette with `ctrl-shift-p` and find the keyboard short cut for delete.  Click on the cell you want to delete, and use the `delete` keyboard shortcut.\n","\n","7. As you make changes, Jupyter saves your notebook automatically, but if you want to make sure, you can go to `File >> Save` or click `ctrl-s`.\n","\n","That should be enough basics for now.

If we're modeling the impacts of introducing a non-native species to an ecosystem, for instance, we cannot (ethically!) observe that in practice.

In this chapter, we will model the velocity of a penny as it is dropped from the Empire State Building.  Let's imagine we know nothing about gravity.  Direct investigation in New York City would be difficult and illegal.  But we could do a little experiment with a penny and a ladder to try to get a sense about how the penny would behave.  After a couple trials, we might recognize that the penny seems to fall faster the longer it is in the air.

Wind speed? Humidity?  It might seem strange that we decide to ignore some factors in a system.  But a model is always simpler than the system itself--that's what makes it useful.  Imagine if a map were the same size as the landscape: this wouldn't be a very useful model!  \n","\n","2. Define the relationships among these factors.
