In the metric system, if we always put our values in $kg$ (kilogram),$m$ (meter), and $s$ (seconds), as well as other more complex base units like Newtons and Watts, we know that our answer will be in base units (presuming we set up our equations correctly).  This often requires using exponential format for our numbers (like 8.67e7 instead of 86700000), since a given simulation might include millions of seconds or a small fraction of a kg, but it allows us to generally avoid unit conversions.
