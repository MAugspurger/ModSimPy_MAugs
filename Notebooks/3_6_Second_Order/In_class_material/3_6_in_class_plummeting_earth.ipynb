Note that much of the code will echo the penny problem in this, so don't try to start from scratch!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Here are some suggestions about how to proceed:\n","\n","1.  Look up the Law of Universal Gravitation so that you can understand the force that the sun creates on the earth. The gravitation acceleration $g = 9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2}$ only works at the earth's surface, so we can't use that here!\n","\n","2. You can avoid conversion problems by working entirely in SI units: meters, kilograms, and Newtons.\n","\n","3.  When the distance between the Earth and the Sun gets small, this system behaves badly, so you should find a way to stop the simulation when the surface of Earth reaches the surface of the Sun.  This may mean you need to check at each time step how far away the earth and the sun are!\n","\n","4. You can assume that the sun will not move a significant amount (it's really big!), so you only need to consider the velocity and the position of the earth.  But if you want a challenge, try to include the position and velocity of the sun: in this case, you'll need 4 state variables instead of just 2.\n","\n","5. Express your answer in days, and plot the results (ideally as millions of kilometers versus days, but that's not crucial).\n","\n","6. Follow the steps listed in the cells below, and start by looking at how that step is done in the penny problem (for example, how is \"init\" created above?)\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"forbidden-distributor"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define your parameters (radii and mass of the earth and sun,\n","# gravitational constant G (not g!)\n","# Using base metric units (no conversions necessary)\n","r_earth = 6.378e6       # radius of earth, m\n","r_sun = 6.9634e8        # radius of sun, m\n","init_pE = 1.4722e11     # initial position of earth, in m\n","m_earth = 5.972e24      # mass of the earth, kg\n","m_sun = 1.989e30        # mass of the sun, kg\n","G_constant = 6.674e-11  # universal gravitational constant, m^3/(s^2 kg)\n","\n","# Create an initial state Series with position and velocity\n","# (if your sun is moving, you'll need these for the sun and earth)\n","\n","\n","# Create a system dictionary with the system parameters\n","# Include a 't_end=1e8' as an arbitrary stopping point\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"former-taxation"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define a slope function\n","def change_func(t, state, system):\n","    # Unpack your state and system (this is optional)\n","\n","\n","    # Define the force between the two objects\n","\n","\n","    # Define the dydt and dvdt for earth (look at penny example for help)\n","    # You'll need Newton's law for dvdt (and make the sign: which direction\n","    # is the force pulling?)
