Look up the Law of Universal Gravitation so that you can understand the force that the sun creates on the earth.  \n","\n","2. You can avoid conversion problems by working entirely in SI units: meters, kilograms, and Newtons.\n","\n","3.  When the distance between the Earth and the Sun gets small, this system behaves badly, so you should use an event function to stop when the surface of Earth reaches the surface of the Sun.\n","\n","4. Assume that the sun will not move a significant amount (it's really big!), so you only need to consider the velocity and the position of the earth.\n","\n","5. Express your answer in days, and plot the results (ideally as millions of kilometers versus days, but that's not crucial).\n","\n","6.
