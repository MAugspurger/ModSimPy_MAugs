In this challenge task, you'll model the classic stochastic system: gambling.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","In this exercise, you will test out two different strategies for playing the game of roulette, to test whether betting strategy makes a difference in a game of pure chance.

This is a standard spin-the-wheel casino game, in which a gambler bets that the wheel will stop on a certain number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette).  Your boss is convinced that if you just keep betting half of your remaining money each spin of roulette that you are sure to make money: after all, you can never run out of money, but have the opportunity to win a big pot.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","So he wants you to compare two scenarios.  In the first one, the gambler will bet 2 dollars every bet.  In the second one, the gambler will bet half the remaining money, no matter how much money is remaining (so if you start with 100 dollars, the gambler's first bet will be 50 dollars; if that bet loses, the next bet would be 25 dollars, etc...)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"228bda5d","metadata":{"id":"228bda5d"},"source":["### The details\n","\n","Here are the details.  In both cases:\n","\n","- The gambler starts with \\$100\n","- The gambler always bets according to the rule for that simulation (\\$2 or half the remaining money)\n","- The gambler always bets on a single number\n","- The gambler bets 80 times and then stops, no matter what the results are\n","- If the gambler runs out of money, she can no longer bet\n","- In both cases, you will run 100 simulations of the situation\n","- In roulette, you have a 1/38 chance of winning (36 numbers, 0, and 00).   The payout for a win is 36 times the bet (as well as the return of the bet).  The difference between 38 and 36 is called the *vig*, which is what keeps the casino in business and what makes gambling a Questionable Enterprise (TM).  So to be clear: if the gambler bets 2 dollars on the first bet, and wins, the remaining money would be $ \\$ 100 + (36*\\$ 2) = \\$ 172$.\n","\n","Which of these details are part of the system parameters?

Copy-and-paste is still your friend!  What similarities do you see with the Bikeshare simulation?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Here is what you'll need to do to finish the simulations.  You might think of doing each one of these in a single Jupyter cell.

There is more than one choice, so you'll need to decide what metric makes the most sense.\n","- Define a run_multiple_simulations function that returns your metric(s)\n","\n","\n","Don't do all of this twice!

Which approach is more advantageous?  Are either of them profitable?  Write as if you are reporting back to your boss--you want to make your findings clear (and he has no interest in looking at code output!  That's for tech people, and he's a big picture thinker!).  \n","\n","2) Look at your plots (you can run mult_simulations with a smaller number of simulations if this helps).  What is the difference in the behavior of the two systems?  Is it possible that using a different metric might lead to a different result?\n","\n","3) What happens if the gambler plays 500 times rather than 80.  How do the results change?
