In this challenge task, you'll model the classic stochastic system: gambling.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","In this exercise, you will test out two different strategies for playing the game of roulette, to test whether betting strategy makes a difference in a game of pure chance.

This is a standard spin-the-wheel casino game, in which a gambler bets that the wheel will stop on a certain number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette).  Your boss is convinced that if you just keep betting half of your remaining money each spin of roulette that you are sure to make money: after all, you can never run out of money, but have the opportunity to win a big pot.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/ModSimPy_MAugs/raw/main/Images_and_Data/Images/1_2/beat_the_house.png width = 350>\n","</center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","So he wants you to compare two scenarios.  In the first one, the gambler will bet 2 dollars every bet.  In the second one, the gambler will bet half the remaining money, no matter how much money is remaining (so if you start with 100 dollars, the gambler's first bet will be 50 dollars; if that bet loses, the next bet would be 25 dollars, etc...)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"228bda5d","metadata":{"id":"228bda5d"},"source":["### The details\n","\n","Here are the details.

The payout for a win is 36 times the bet (as well as the return of the bet).  The difference between 38 and 36 is called the *vig*, which is what keeps the casino in business and what makes gambling a Questionable Enterprise$^{TM}$.  So to be clear: if the gambler bets 2 dollars on the first bet, and wins, the remaining money would be $ \\$ 100 + (36*\\$ 2) = \\$ 172$.\n","\n","Which of these details are part of the system parameters?
