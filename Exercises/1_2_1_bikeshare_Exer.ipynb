So as we start out, it's important to get a sense of the different kinds of models.  We can divide models in any number of different ways, based on, their underlying math, their behavior, their relationship to time, etc...  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","We've already seen one way to describe a model: its purpose.  Some models are built to explain, others to predict, and others to optimize.   Let's look at a few other ways to categorize models."],"metadata":{"id":"3sXvP1OcOtqS"},"id":"3sXvP1OcOtqS"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Behavior: Stochastic vs. Deterministic\n","\n","A stochastic model is one that is governed by a random function of some sort.  This \"randomness\" might be a result of the complexity of the system: for instance, a model of traffic at an intersection would have to take into account the fact that at some moments a large number of cars might be in the vicinity of the intersection, while at others it might be empty.  At other times the randomness is inherent in the nature of the system: the movement of quantum particles, for instance, is (as far as we can tell) genuinely random, so a quantum model needs to take this into account.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","When a stochastic model is implemented, the results of an individual simulation will vary from simulation to simulation, even if the initial conditions stay the same.  The *results* of such models, then, tend to be reported in terms of statistics: the *average* time for a car to move through the intersection is 36 seconds, for instance.  In such cases, variability is important too: do most cars take between 34-38 seconds, or do some take 2 seconds while others sit at the intersection for 120 seconds? \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","A deterministic model, on the other hand, is governed by a hard and fast rule, and an individual simulation run with the same initial conditions will always produce the same result.  If I model the rise in temperature of a metal block that I put in boiling water, I would expect to see the same temperature curve every time I put the same metal block into the same boiling water."],"metadata":{"id":"e854gpMiPhwD"},"id":"e854gpMiPhwD"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["✅ Active Reading: Describe in your own words the difference between a stochastic and deterministic model."],"metadata":{"id":"wR_cz56svABE"},"id":"wR_cz56svABE"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Type of Implementation: Analytical vs. Computational\n","\n","The way we solved the penny problem in the previous chapter was to take an equation and apply that equation to a particular situation.  This is called an *analytical* model.  This means essentially that the tool we use to solve the problem is mathematical.  As we'll see, we can use analytical tools to model much more complicated systems, too.  The advantage of an analytical model is that it gives us a clear mathematical expression of the nature of the problem--it's great for providing a way to compare one system to another.   If I say, \"I'm going to model the height of a growing tree as a linear system,\" we're saying that the height $h$ of the tree can be represented as a linear mathematical equation (as a function of time $t$ with a constant $C$):\n","\n","$$h=Ct$$\n","\n","We know a lot about linear systems, and can compare this system to other known examples: this is helpful for understanding the behavior of a system.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","A *computational* model depends on using a computer, rather than just mathematical tools, to implement the model.  In doing so, we might lose sight the mathematical nature of the system.  But the advantage is that we can model much more complex systems with computational models than with analytical ones.  There might not be a mathematical solution to a complex geometry (say, the shape of a car) moving in a complex system (say, a windy road), but with enough computational power, we can create a model that describes how that system behaves. \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"93H7lr-FSGpi"},"id":"93H7lr-FSGpi"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["✅ Active Reading: What is the main advantage of an analytical model and of a computational model?"],"metadata":{"id":"SYtH3Dq4vLg0"},"id":"SYtH3Dq4vLg0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Known values: Initial values vs. Boundary values\n","\n","Much of the time we are interested in what happens to a system as it moves through time.  If we know the starting values in a system, and have a model for how those values interact with each other, we can implement an *initial value model*.  Such a simulation will move through time step-by-step, recording the change in conditions along the way.   As you can imagine, this sort of problem is often useful for predictive purposes: what will happen to this system in time?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","A *boundary value model*, on the other hand, is concerned only with a single moment in time, but is interested in the state of the system through space.   If I have an aluminum bar of a complex shape, and know that I am going to keep one end of the bar motionless while moving the other end by 2 cm, I might want to know where the bar might crack.  We could create a boundary value model that detailed the state of stress within the bar with the given change in location of one end of the bar.  This would be a boundary value model.\n","\n","<br> \n","\n","These are not the only way to describe differences in models, but it is a good start.  Over the next couple chapters, we'll encounter some of these types as we learn to build and improve our models and simulations.  In this chapter, for instance, we will look at a stochastic initial value problem that aims to optimize a design through a computational implementation.  In the next chapter, we'll work through an example of a deterministic model with an analytical solution designed to help us understand and predict the behavior of a system.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"7K523T1JVZw7"},"id":"7K523T1JVZw7"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The Bikeshare Problem\n","\n","One purpose of modeling is to optimize an engineered system.
