The more code you write before you start debugging, the harder it is to find the problem.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","*Incremental development* is a way of programming that tries to\n","minimize the pain of debugging. You might not have noticed, but we've been doing incremental development in our notebook and exercises.  The fundamental steps are:\n","\n","1.  Always start with a working program. If you have an example from a\n","    book, or a program you wrote that is similar to what you are working\n","    on, start with that. Otherwise, start with something you *know* is\n","    correct, like `x=5`. Run the program and confirm that it does what\n","    you expect.\n","\n","2.  Make one small, testable change at a time. A \"testable\" change is\n","    one that displays something or has some other effect you can check.\n","    Ideally, you should know what the correct answer is, or be able to\n","    check it by performing another computation.\n","\n","3.  Run the program and see if the change worked. If so, go back to\n","    Step 2. If not, you have to do some debugging, but if the\n","    change you made was small, it shouldn't take long to find the\n","    problem.\n","\n","When this process works, your changes usually work the first time, or if they don't, the problem is obvious. In practice, there are two problems with incremental development:\n","\n","-   Sometimes you have to write extra code to generate visible output\n","    that you can check. This extra code is called *scaffolding*\n","    because you use it to build the program and then remove it when you\n","    are done. That might seem like a waste, but time you spend on\n","    scaffolding is almost always time you save on debugging.\n","\n","-   When you are getting started, it might not be obvious how to choose\n","    the steps that get from `x=5` to the program you are trying to\n","    write. You will see more examples of this process as we go along,\n","    and you will get better with experience.\n","\n","The exercises below ask you to iterate the model we've created above.  If you find yourself writing more than a few lines of code before you\n","start testing, and you are spending a lot of time debugging, remember to take small steps and constantly check the results of your changes!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bearing-orbit","metadata":{"id":"bearing-orbit"},"source":["### Exercise 1\n","\n","✅ Because our simulations are random, the results vary from one run to another, and the results of a parameter sweep tend to be noisy.

The first step is going to be to run a function that runs the same exact simulation multiple times and stores the results.\n","\n","* In the first cell below, write a function called `run_multiple_simulations` that takes as parameters `p1`, `p2`, `iAug`,`iMol`, `num_steps`, and `num_runs`.\n","`num_runs` specifies how many times it should call `run_simulation`.
