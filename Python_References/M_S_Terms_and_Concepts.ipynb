This means that the language is built around \"objects\" that have defined capabilities and characteristics.  What a vague sentence, right?!  Think of it this way.  Some languages are procedural: they follow a clear set of directions in the code (do this, then do that, then...).  Object oriented code makes some things, and then when the code runs, it tells the things to do stuff (make two cats, make three dogs, now all animals make a noise (at which point the dogs bark and cats meow)...).

But this understates the importance of the idea.
